    Augmented reality (AR) is impacting medical practice and ultimately improving patient outcomes. Methods of hospital imaging are largely focused on the structures of the body such as bones and organs including X-rays, CT scans, MRI and ultrasound. AR takes these to a new level by overlaying images and 3D models onto the real world so viewers can see the intricacies of human anatomy in high definition at any time. AR enables in-depth viewing of organs, with substantial educational and practical benefits. During surgery, AR allows surgeons to visualise the internal organs to be operated on comprehensively by projecting 2D or 3D images. This in turn helps practitioners more easily to identify disorders and make decisions. With this concept, medical professionals are now using AR tools to perform their diagnosis and treatment efficiently. Doctors use AR continuously, combining it with their expertise to make informed diagnoses and treatment plans, ultimately saving lives.
