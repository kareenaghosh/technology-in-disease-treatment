Wearable technology is an effective way for humans to keep track of their health and find out whether they have symptoms of illnesses.

Fig. 1: People can buy portable, wearable ECG machines where they can monitor heartbeats and analyse irregularity. With this data, doctors are able to find any cardiological diseases within the patient easier.
<br>
<br>
Fig. 2: Type 1 diabetes patients wear Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGM), which help them track their blood glucose rate on their phones. The CGM can stop young patients from fainting by telling how low or high their blood glucose is, which affects what they eat and how active they are.

Fig. 3: A smartwatch has many apps regulating health according to personal details. For example, the Apple Watch makes users input any illnesses they have and has heart rate, ECG and blood oxygen apps preinstalled. The Apple Watch also has a built-in feature that senses whether someone is showing signs of arrhythmia through the data from the apps.
