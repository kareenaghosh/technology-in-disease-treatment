  <h2 class="about"> 
     When I first started researching, I was inquisitive about what developments biomedical scientists and engineers have invented for humanity as I have an interest in human biology. I imagine that most people have not been following the evolutions of technology in the health industry. They would not be able to investigate if they were busy or did not know where to start looking. Since there is so much technology in disease treatment now, it can be quite overwhelming trying to find where to begin. I have designed this website to give straightforward examples of technology in disease treatment. Also with this website, I hope that people become more interested in technology developments in the health environment.
